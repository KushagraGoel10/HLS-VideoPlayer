HLS VideoPlayer ->
( HTTP LIVE STREAMING Player) 

I've coded this videoplayer using video.js to optimize our react app for videos. 
It has some features such as - 

1) It loads videos in chunks.
2) It adapts to user's internet speed i.e quality of the video depends on how fast a user's internet is.
3) No need to download the complete video as it loads in chunks.
4) It reduces our react app load.

I have used Video.js here as it supports both HLS and DASH.
